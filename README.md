# PHP 5.3 FPM

PHP 5.3 [reached EOL](http://php.net/eol.php) on 14 Aug 2014 and thus, official docker support was [dropped](https://github.com/docker-library/php/pull/20). I still needed to run 5.3 with FPM so I built this image based on the latest official builds of PHP.

# What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development, but which can also be used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP can be added to straight HTML or it can be used with a variety of templating engines and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by an interpreter, which is either implemented as a native module on the web-server or as a common gateway interface (CGI).

# How to use this image.

## With Command Line

For PHP projects run through the command line interface (CLI), you can do the following.

### Create a `Dockerfile` in your PHP project

    FROM andthensome/docker-php-5.3-fpm
    COPY . /usr/src/myapp
    WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
    CMD [ "php", "./your-script.php" ]

Then, run the commands to build and run the Docker image:

    docker build -t my-php-app .
    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-php-app

### Run a single PHP script

For many simple, single file projects, you may find it inconvenient to write a complete `Dockerfile`. In such cases, you can run a PHP script by using the PHP Docker image directly:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp helder/php-5.3 php your-script.php

### Without a `Dockerfile`

If you don't want to include a `Dockerfile` in your project, it is sufficient to do the following:

    docker run -it --rm --name my-php-fpm-app -v "$PWD":/var/www/html helder/php-5.3
